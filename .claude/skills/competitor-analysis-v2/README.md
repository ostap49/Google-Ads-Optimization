# Competitor Analysis v2

An 8-phase competitive analysis workflow that combines website intelligence, ad copy evaluation, and visual documentation to produce either a strategic Client Gift (PDF) or tactical Ads Angle Brief (markdown).

**The pain point:** Competitor analysis is usually either superficial (just looking at their ads) or so time-consuming nobody does it properly. This skill runs a structured 8-phase pipeline — screenshots, website extraction, ad scoring, gap identification, client verification — and produces two distinct outputs: a strategic report for the client and a tactical brief for the practitioner.

## What's Inside

- 8-phase workflow: Gather Inputs, Capture Screenshots, Extract Website Content, Analyze Ads, Gap Identification, Client Verification, Generate Outputs, PDF Generation
- Parallel website extraction using Task agents (6 sites in ~1 minute)
- 22-attribute ad copy scoring framework (15 strategic + 7 tactical)
- Messaging matrix and 2x2 positioning map generation
- Gap analysis: table stakes vs. differentiators vs. whitespace
- Mandatory client verification phase — no recommendations without website evidence
- Two output formats: Client Gift (10-15 page PDF) and Ads Angle Brief (1 page tactical)
- Playwright-based screenshot capture script
