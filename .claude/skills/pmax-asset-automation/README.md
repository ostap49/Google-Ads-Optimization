# PMax Asset Automation

Audit and fix Performance Max campaign asset automation settings. Opts out of Google's auto-generated headlines, descriptions, videos, and image enhancements that often produce off-brand or hallucinated output.

**The pain point:** Performance Max ships with five asset automation settings turned ON by default. Google generates new text assets, expands your final URLs, edits your YouTube videos, auto-crops images, and extracts new images from your landing pages — all without per-asset approval. The generated assets frequently drift off-brand or contradict verified business claims. There is no UI for portfolio-wide auditing — you have to click into each campaign one at a time. This skill codifies the "all five OPTED_OUT" standard and gives you an API-based workflow to audit and enforce it at scale.
