# Ads Checker

Audit Google Ads accounts for creative compliance across 10 checks — DKI, auto-created assets, broken URLs, ad disapprovals, stale seasonal copy, URL expansion, auto-applied recommendations, inappropriate/Fair-Housing-risk content, spelling, and irrelevance — then layer an intelligence system on top: issue-history comparison run-over-run, chronic-issue detection (3+ occurrences in 90 days), and a cached feed for a daily briefing.

**The pain point:** Creative problems are easy to miss at portfolio scale and expensive when they linger — a disapproved ad bleeds spend, a broken final URL kills conversions, an auto-applied "broad match keyword" recommendation quietly wrecks targeting, and a stale "Summer Special" runs into October. Eyeballing dozens of accounts doesn't scale, and a one-shot audit tells you *what's* wrong today but not whether it's *new*, *getting worse*, or *the same thing for the fifth week running*. This skill encodes a repeatable audit plus the memory to tell the difference — so you triage by severity AND by trend, and chronic offenders surface on their own.

## What's Inside

- **10 creative-compliance checks** with severity logic (CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / OK), spanning policy, automation settings, copy hygiene, and relevance
- **Issue-history comparison** — every run tags each issue type NEW / INCREASED / DECREASED / RESOLVED / SAME vs the last audit
- **Chronic-issue detection** — flags accounts where an issue has recurred 3+ times in 90 days, so persistent problems escalate automatically
- **Brand-aware spelling** — account/brand names load as spelling exceptions so real property names don't false-positive
- **Fair-Housing-aware** content screening for discriminatory language alongside profanity, violence, scam, and competitor terms
- **Cached-output contract** for a daily briefing — a lightweight reader surfaces the last 24h of CRITICAL/HIGH findings without re-running the audit
- **Severity-ranked Google Sheet output** plus per-account and portfolio trend tabs
- Read-only — never mutates Google Ads

## The Scripts (Ship With This Skill)

Both scripts are included and self-contained — Google Ads API + Google Sheets only, credentials from your `google-ads.yaml`.

**1. [`scripts/ads_checker_audit.py`](scripts/ads_checker_audit.py)** — given `--cid <CID>`, `--cids <CID1,CID2>`, `--portfolio <name>`, or `--all` (plus `--sheet-id` for live runs, `--dry-run` to skip the write), it:

- Queries the Google Ads API for each account's RSAs, assets, campaign settings, policy summaries, and recommendation subscriptions
- Runs the 10 checks and computes an overall severity per account
- Compares each account's issue counts to its most recent prior row (history tab) and tags deltas
- Detects chronic issues (3+ occurrences / 90 days) among HIGH/CRITICAL accounts
- Writes results to a Google Sheet: a `Raw Output` detail tab, an optional per-portfolio tab, a `History` portfolio-trend tab, and an `Account History` per-account tab

**2. [`scripts/read_latest_ads_checker.py`](scripts/read_latest_ads_checker.py)** — given `--sheet-id` and `--critical-only` (optionally `--portfolio <name>`, `--hours-back N`, `--json`), it reads the **cached** `Account History` rows from the last 24h and formats CRITICAL/HIGH accounts for a daily briefing. It does not call the Google Ads API.

**Prerequisites:** `google-ads.yaml` at project root (see [google-ads-api-setup](../google-ads-api-setup/)) and `pip install google-ads gspread google-auth pyyaml requests pyspellchecker`. Optional: an `accounts.json` registry for name/portfolio resolution (schema in the script header) — portfolio names are whatever grouping labels your registry uses; without a registry, `--all` walks the MCC in your `google-ads.yaml`.

**Adaptation hooks (edit the script headers' marked sections):**

- The inappropriate-content blocklist ships with housing-vertical example sets (Fair Housing phrases, listing-aggregator competitor mentions) — swap in your vertical's compliance phrases and competitor list
- The spelling exceptions list ships with common ad abbreviations plus a real-estate example block — extend for your vertical; account/brand names are added automatically from your registry
- Chronic-issue account files are created under `./accounts/<portfolio>/<slug>.md` after an interactive prompt

**The cached-output contract (do not break):** the `Account History` tab must carry `Audit Date` (`%Y-%m-%d %H:%M`), `Portfolio`, `CID`, `Account Name`, `Overall Severity`, and the per-issue `* Count` columns. The reader filters to the last 24h on `Audit Date`. Change the tab name, date format, or headers in one script and you must change them in the other, or the briefing section silently goes blank.

## Usage

**Inline (single account or portfolio):**

> "Run ads checker for the Example portfolio"
> "Creative audit for Customer ID 1234567890"

The skill will:

1. Parse the scope into `--cid` / `--portfolio`
2. Run `scripts/ads_checker_audit.py` (piping `"no"` so the optional chronic-issue prompt never blocks)
3. Surface the severity breakdown, the changes-vs-last-run (NEW/INCREASED/RESOLVED), and any chronic accounts
4. Point you at the Google Sheet output

**Parallel (multiple portfolios at once):**

```
Task(subagent_type="general-purpose",
     description="Audit Portfolio A creative",
     prompt="Use the ads-checker skill to audit the Portfolio A segment.")

Task(subagent_type="general-purpose",
     description="Audit Portfolio B creative",
     prompt="Use the ads-checker skill to audit the Portfolio B segment.")

# ...launched in a single message for parallel execution
```
