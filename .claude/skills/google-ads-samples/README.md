# Google Ads Samples

A reference library of 39 official Google Ads API code samples that auto-loads when building new scripts, agents, or API integrations — so you start from proven patterns instead of guessing.

**The pain point:** The Google Ads API has hundreds of services, operations, and field paths. Writing a new script from scratch means trial-and-error with operation structures, service clients, and error handling. This skill points Claude to the right official example first, cutting implementation time by 50-75% for complex operations.
