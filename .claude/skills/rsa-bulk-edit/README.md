# RSA Bulk Edit

Find-and-replace text across RSA ads in one or more Google Ads accounts, outputting results to a Google Sheet in Google Ads Editor-ready format for review and import.

**The pain point:** A client rebrands, a spelling convention changes, or an old customizer needs replacing across dozens of accounts. Doing find-and-replace ad by ad in the Google Ads UI doesn't scale. This skill queries all RSA headlines, descriptions, and paths, applies your text replacement, and outputs a sheet you can paste directly into Google Ads Editor.

## What's Inside

- Find-and-replace across all RSA headlines (1-15), descriptions (1-4), and path fields
- Single account or multi-account batch processing
- Google Ads Editor-ready output: one row per ad with all 15 headlines, 4 descriptions, paths, and final URL
- "Has Match" column for quick filtering to only affected ads
- Dry-run mode for previewing matches without writing to sheet
- Case-insensitive search by default with optional case-sensitive flag
- Custom tab naming for organized review
