# Geo Conflict Analyzer

Analyzes search queries for geographic targeting conflicts in Google Ads GEO campaigns. Uses OpenAI GPT-4o to decide if a query is **safe to negative** (PASS — doesn't conflict with active geo targets) or **should NOT be negatived** (FAIL — matches an active geo target and negativing would block real traffic).

**The pain point:** Adding negatives from search query reports is how you clean an account, but if you negative "apartments in chula vista" while you're actively bidding on "Chula Vista" as a geo ad group, you just broke your own campaign. Manually checking every query against every geo target across dozens of accounts is tedious and error-prone. This skill catches the conflicts before you add the negative.

## What It Prevents

- Negativing a query that matches one of your active geo targets (direct match, abbreviation, preposition variation, typo)
- Negativing a query that's a *more-specific* version of an active geo (e.g., "downtown chula vista apartments" when you actively target "Chula Vista")
- Manually reviewing 500+ queries per account per month

## What It Does

1. Reads queries from a Google Sheet tab (status = "Waiting")
2. Groups by CID and looks up each account's active geo targets
3. Sends batches of 50 queries to GPT-4o with a 200+ example ruleset
4. Writes PASS/FAIL + confidence back to an output tab

Pairs with [`sqr-pipeline`](../sqr-pipeline/) — its off-brand classification runs first, then geo-conflict runs on queries that need geographic validation.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- `pip install openai google-auth google-api-python-client python-dotenv`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` set in a `.env` file or environment variable
- Google Sheets OAuth token at `./token.json` (see [google-ads-api-setup](../google-ads-api-setup/) skill — the Sheets scope can be added to the same token)

## Usage

```bash
# Basic run (50 queries)
python scripts/analyze.py --sheet-id YOUR_SHEET_ID

# Larger batch
python scripts/analyze.py --sheet-id YOUR_SHEET_ID --batch-size 100

# Dry run (no writes)
python scripts/analyze.py --sheet-id YOUR_SHEET_ID --dry-run
```
